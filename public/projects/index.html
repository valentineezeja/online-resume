<p>This is a simple repository for projects I have worked on, usually during weekends. A quick summary of each project and a link to a blog post detailing the required steps would be provided for each project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please be aware that this page will be modified frequently to add updates.</p>

    <h2>
        • Project 1: <a href="https://resume.valentineezeja.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An online website served from Amazon S3 and CloudFront</a>

    </h2> 
</p>
<p>This project involves creating an online resume/CV using HTML and CSS, then hosting the site on S3 and serving it via CloudFront distribution. 
    
GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/valentineezeja/online-resume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/valentineezeja/online-resume</a> 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    <h4>The following technologies were used to complete the project:</h4>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>• HTML/CSS for designing the resume</p>
<p>• S3 & CloudFront for hosting, distributing and caching the page</p>
<p>• Route53 and ACM for configuring the domains/DNS records and configuring SSL certificate respectively</p>
<p>• JavaScript and DynamoDB for page visitor count display and storage of the visitor count respectively </p>
<p>• AWS CDK for Python (Boto3) used for the Lambda function</p>
<p>• API Gateway for communicating with DynamoDB via Lambda</p>
<p>• Amazon SAM for deploying the resources (API, Lambda, and DynamoDB)</p>
<p>• Git for version  control</p>
<p>• GitHub Actions for CI/CD</p>
<p></p>
<p>NB: There have been some erratic behaviours with the count fetch from DynamodB, hence I've had to temporarily remove the feature until I fix it soon.</p>

            • Project 2: <a href="https://mxa6w7azhe.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A simple serverless web app for London local weather</a>
    
        </h2> 
    </p>
    <p>This project involves creating a serveless weather app and deploying it to AWS solely via Terraform.

        <h4>The following technologies were used to complete the project:</h4>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>• Terraform used for deploying the infrastructure</p>
    <p>• HTML/CSS and Node  for designing the app</p>
    <p>• S3  for initially hosting the web files (source for Lambda function)</p>
    <p>• Lambda used for hosting the web files</p>
    <p>• API Gateway for serving the content by making calls to Lambda </p>

        • Project 3: <a href="https://valscloud.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A self-hosted tech blog</a>
    </h2>
</p>
<p>I have been interested in technical writing lately, and while there are free platforms for this purpose, I chose to personally host my website. 
    This approach gives me the opportunity to<br> manage a live environment as I am fully responsible for maintaining and protecting the prod environment.<br>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    This project is about 70% ready and currently offline as I am sorting out the security bits and organising contents before it goes live.
    Also, the site would be available only during work hours<br> for now as the server is scheduled to only run during the day to minimise costs🤑; the plan is to re-factor this into a highly available and scalable architecture when the blog grows. <br> 
    
<p></p>
<p>This page will be updated as I progress. In the meantime, a snapshot of the current stage of the site can be found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221123014455/https://valscloud.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

    <h4>Technologies used for the project so far:</h3>
</p>
