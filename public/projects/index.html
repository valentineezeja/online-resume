        <h1>Personal projects â€“ 2022</h1>
<p>This is a simple repository for projects I have worked on, usually during weekends. A quick summary of each project and a link to a blog post detailing the required steps would be provided for each project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please be aware that this page will be modified frequently to add updates.</p>

    <h2>
        â€¢ Project 1: <a href="https://resume.valentineezeja.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An online website served from Amazon S3 and CloudFront</a>

    </h2> 
</p>
<p>This project involves creating an online resume/CV using HTML and CSS, then hosting the site on S3 and serving it via CloudFront distribution. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
    <h4>The following technologies were used to complete the project:</h4>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>â€¢ HTML/CSS for designing the resume</p>
<p>â€¢ S3 & CloudFront for hosting, distributing and caching the page</p>
<p>â€¢ Route53 and ACM for configuring the domains/DNS records and configuring SSL certificate respectively</p>
<p>â€¢ JavaScript and DynamoDB for page visitor count display and storage of the visitor count respectively </p>
<p>â€¢ AWS CDK for Python (Boto3) used for the Lambda function</p>
<p>â€¢ API Gateway for communicating with DynamoDB via Lambda</p>
<p>â€¢ Amazon SAM for deploying the resources (API, Lambda, and DynamoDB)</p>
<p>â€¢ GitHub for source control</p>
<p>â€¢ GitHub Actions for CI/CD</p>
<p></p>
<p>NB: There have been some erratic behaviours with the count fetch from DynamodB, hence I've had to temporarily remove the feature until I fix it soon.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

    <h2>
        â€¢ Project 2: <a href="https://valscloud.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A self-hosted tech blog</a>
    </h2>
</p>
<p>I have been looking into technical writing of late and while there are free platforms for this purpose, I chose to personally host my website. 
    This approach gives me the opportunity to<br> manage a live environment as I am fully responsible for maintaining and protecting the prod environment.<br>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    This project is about 70% ready and currently offline as I am sorting out the security bits and organising contents before it goes live.
    Also, the site would be available only during work hours<br> for now as the server is scheduled to only run during the day to minimise costsðŸ¤‘; the plan is to re-factor this into a highly available and scalable architecture when the blog grows. <br> 
    
<p></p>
<p>This page will be updated as I progress.</p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    <h4>Technologies used for the project so far:</h3>
</p>
<p>â€¢ CloudFormation for deploying resources to AWS</p>
<p>â€¢ Converted the CFN template to Terraform just to understand how it works and the differences</p>
<p>â€¢  Amazon EC2 (RHEL) for web content and database host for now</p>
<p>â€¢  CloudWatch for monitoring</p>
<p>â€¢  Apache web server for hosting the website</p>
<p>â€¢  WordPress for CMS</p>
<p>â€¢  Docker for image backup </p>
<p></p>
